# big project 

initial text today is a great day but I think I'm going to make some big changes to this file very soon 

like maybe a new paragraph but 
somewhere along the line there will be some collaborative edits
and I will want to branch and then merge this markdown file

### section 2

it's what you don't see that matters

### some more stuff

<!-- please check markdown guides for proper list item syntax -->

1. here's a list item
2. another idea
3. A roundabout way of saying mostly nothing
4. a well intentioned but terrible idea NOT up for debate
5. a great idea that we have to incorporate
